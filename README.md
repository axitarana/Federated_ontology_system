# Federated_ontology_system
An ontology system for Iowa Liquor Sales datasets from Kaggle and data.iowa.gov. 
The goal is to provide a tool to a hypothetical liquor business owner that would help in getting insights about liquor sales in the state of Iowa.
The API shows a few queries/insights that were designed based on the datasets. 
The ontology was created using Protégé.
There can be multiple queries related to the dataset and therefore the API can be extended and made more interactive. 
The focus of the project is generating accurate results after extracting them from the ontology.
